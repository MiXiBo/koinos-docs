# Overview
Welcome to the Koinos overview! In this section, we will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and features of the Koinos blockchain.

## Blockchain Basics
To begin, let's delve into the basics of blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable record of all transactions.

## Tokenomics
Tokenomics refers to the economic model and dynamics surrounding the native coin of the Koinos blockchain. The Koinos coin serves various purposes within the ecosystem, including access to resources, network governance, and incentivizing participation.

## Proof-of-Burn
Koinos introduces a unique consensus mechanism known as proof-of-burn. This innovative approach involves burning tokens to validate transactions and secure the network. By sacrificing tokens through burning, participants demonstrate their commitment to the network's integrity and consensus.

## Mana
Mana is a key concept in the Koinos ecosystem, representing the access to resources within the network. Through the accumulation of KOIN, which contain mana, users can perform transactions on the network without transaction fees.

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts play a crucial role in the functionality of the Koinos blockchain. These self-executing contracts are written in code and automatically enforce the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) to be built on the Koinos platform.

## Koinos Virtual Machine (KVM)
The Koinos Virtual Machine (KVM) is a powerful execution environment that enables the deployment and execution of smart contracts on the Koinos blockchain. Leveraging the KVM, developers can write smart contracts using a variety of programming languages and deploy them securely on the network.

## WebAssembly (WASM)
At the heart of the KVM lies WebAssembly (WASM), a binary instruction format that enables high-performance execution of smart contracts. WASM provides a secure and efficient runtime environment for executing code on the Koinos blockchain, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
